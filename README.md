# E-Commerce-Analytics-in-Power-BI

Developed an interactive E-Commerce Sales Analysis Dashboard using Power BI to visualize and analyze the performance of an online retail business. The dashboard includes key metrics such as total sales, profit, quantity sold, and shipping cost. Visual elements like bar charts, pie charts, treemaps, and KPIs were used to present insights by state, market, category, and ship mode. Filters were applied to allow users to view data by region, market, and shipping method. The dashboard revealed that the Technology category had the highest sales, APAC and EU were the top-performing markets, and Standard Class was the most used shipping method. It also highlighted that states like California and countries like England contributed significantly to overall revenue. This project involved data cleaning, DAX calculations, and report design in Power BI, resulting in a tool that helps stakeholders make informed decisions on marketing strategies, product focus, and logistics optimization.
